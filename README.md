# Calcium23
The files and download for Calcium23, the official game engine of BonePlus.

# What is Calcium23?
Calcium23 is a VR game engine to make a game function like BoneLab. This specific one I made (with some imported features from different repositories so credit to all of those people) is going to be imported into my VR game, BonePlus.
# What is BonePlus?
BonePlus is a VR game I am working on made to be a better version of BoneLab (no hate to BoneLab though) by adding in features such as Wick flicking, removing bullets from guns (magazines, clips, etc.),  fixing items/tools (flashlight, etc.), adding better physics (no hate to 1Marrow either), fixing glitches (fly/clip glitches, sprint glitches, etc.), and other things.
